# LibriTTS-British

This is a subset of the [LibriTTS dataset](https://openslr.org/60/) that includes British speakers.

Speakers are sorted into `libritts-english`, `libritts-irish`, `libritts-scottish`, and `libritts-welsh` subsets.

Speakers were found using two resources, the [LibriVox Accents Table](https://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Accents_Table) and [Ruth Golding's Blog](https://golding.wordpress.com/home/other-british-readers-on-librivox), which both compile a list of British LibriVox audiobook speakers.

Please be aware that this dataset is *likely not complete*, and *I make no promises of the regional accuracy*.
